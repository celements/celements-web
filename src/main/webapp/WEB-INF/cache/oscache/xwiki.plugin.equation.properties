# This property file configures local-only caches
# Clustered cache settings should be done in oscache.properties


# CACHE IN MEMORY
# If you want to disable memory caching, just uncomment this line.
# cache.memory=false
cache.memory=true


# CACHE KEY
#
# This is the key that will be used to store the cache in the application
# and session scope.
#
# If you want to set the cache key to anything other than the default
# uncomment this line and change the cache.key
#
# cache.key=XWiki-Local


# USE HOST DOMAIN NAME IN KEY
#
# Servers for multiple host domains may wish to add host name info to
# the generation of the key.  If this is true, then uncomment the
# following line.
#
# cache.use.host.domain.in.key=true


# CACHE LISTENERS
#
# These hook OSCache events and perform various actions such as logging
# cache hits and misses, or broadcasting to other cache instances across a cluster.
# See the documentation for further information.
#
# cache.event.listeners=com.opensymphony.oscache.plugins.clustersupport.JMSBroadcastingListener,  \
#                       com.opensymphony.oscache.extra.CacheEntryEventListenerImpl,               \

# CACHE PERSISTENCE CLASS
#
# Specify the class to use for persistence. If you use the supplied DiskPersistenceListener,
# don't forget to supply the cache.path property to specify the location of the cache
# directory.
# 
# If a persistence class is not specified, OSCache will use memory caching only.
#
# cache.persistence.class=com.opensymphony.oscache.plugins.diskpersistence.DiskPersistenceListener
cache.persistence.class=com.opensymphony.oscache.plugins.diskpersistence.DiskPersistenceListener

# CACHE OVERFLOW PERSISTENCE
# Use persistent cache in overflow or not. The default value is false, which means
# the persistent cache will be used at all times for every entry.  true is the recommended setting.
#
# cache.persistence.overflow.only=true
cache.persistence.overflow.only=false

# CACHE DIRECTORY
#
# This is the directory on disk where caches will be stored by the DiskPersistenceListener.
# it will be created if it doesn't already exist. Remember that OSCache must have
# write permission to this directory.
#
# Note: for Windows machines, this needs \ to be escaped
# ie Windows:
# cache.path=c:\\myapp\\cache
# or *ix:
# cache.path=/opt/myapp/cache
#
# cache.path=c:\\app\\cache


# CACHE ALGORITHM
#
# Default cache algorithm to use. Note that in order to use an algorithm
# the cache size must also be specified. If the cache size is not specified,
# the cache algorithm will be Unlimited cache.
#
# cache.algorithm=com.opensymphony.oscache.base.algorithm.LRUCache
# cache.algorithm=com.opensymphony.oscache.base.algorithm.FIFOCache
# cache.algorithm=com.opensymphony.oscache.base.algorithm.UnlimitedCache

# THREAD BLOCKING BEHAVIOR
#
# When a request is made for a stale cache entry, it is possible that another thread is already
# in the process of rebuilding that entry. This setting specifies how OSCache handles the
# subsequent 'non-building' threads. The default behaviour (cache.blocking=false) is to serve
# the old content to subsequent threads until the cache entry has been updated. This provides
# the best performance (at the cost of serving slightly stale data). When blocking is enabled,
# threads will instead block until the new cache entry is ready to be served. Once the new entry
# is put in the cache the blocked threads will be restarted and given the new entry.
# Note that even if blocking is disabled, when there is no stale data available to be served
# threads will block until the data is added to the cache by the thread that is responsible
# for building the data.
#
# cache.blocking=false
cache.blocking=false

# CACHE SIZE
#
# Default cache size in number of items. If a size is specified but not
# an algorithm, the cache algorithm used will be LRUCache.
#
cache.capacity=1000

# CACHE UNLIMITED DISK
# Use unlimited disk cache or not. The default value is false, which means
# the disk cache will be limited in size to the value specified by cache.capacity.
#
# cache.unlimited.disk=false
cache.unlimited.disk=true

# JMS CLUSTER PROPERTIES
# This cache is for non clustered caches only, cluster settings should be done in oscache-clustered.properties
