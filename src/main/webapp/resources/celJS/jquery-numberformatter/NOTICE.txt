Current Release: 1.2.3 Requires jQuery and jshashtable

This plugin is a number formatting and parsing plugin for jQuery.

Number formatting is likely familiar to anyone who's worked with server-side code like 
Java or PHP and who has worked with internationalization. People who aren't stuck in the 
US-centric frame of mind can quickly point out that people in other parts of the world 
don't format their numbers in the same way as Americans. For example, a number that we 
would write in the US as "1,250,500.75" would be written differently in different 
countries: "1.250.500,75" in Germany, "1 250 500,75" in France, and "1'250'500.75" in 
Switzerland, and "125,0500.75" in Japan. The number is exactly the same, but it's just 
written using a different format when presented to users of the web application.

I've been working during the 1.2 rewrite to separate the parsing and formatting more. 
So your now required to parse the text first into a js number, before formatting it back 
into text. This should hopefully give more control over the process and allow more 
flexibility of use.
